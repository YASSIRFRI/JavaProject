Things we need to talk about:
- dependency between piece constructor and boardSquare constructor
- validateMove() should take board as parameter
- should i set move status in validateMove() method?
- getValidMoves() return type is ArrayList instead of Array
- we should add a method: kingCanBeKilled() and use it in getValidMoves()
- added hasMoved attribute in Pawn class (to use it in getValidMoves())
- how the board 2d array should be



we have being doing it all wrong, we should not separat fucntional code with gui code
from what i'v seen, square for example, should extend Rectangle, and have a piece as an image view
and so on (gameboard gridpane) 



- to check if king is in threat, i should create temp different color pieces in his same location and check if I can kill some piece
- I need to reimplement the pawn getValidMoves() and consider the orientation(yuup it is not working for black pawns)(good job
finding the new images)



-I will start thinking about how to move pieces around

-I found another problem:
the event listener are actaly the squares not the imageviews so when we click on the center of the imageview it will not work
notice that it works only when we click on the border of the square
I'm working on that
