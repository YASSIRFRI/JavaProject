- We need to update the state of pieces (the array of blackPieces and whitePieces, as well as right/left white/black rooks
- Castling is working but if you reverse the move, the rook will not return to its place
-I was about to tell you this.
-I fixed reverse castling, now the move is not commited in the game class it is integrated inside
the do move method
