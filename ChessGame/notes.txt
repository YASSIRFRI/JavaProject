Things we need to talk about:
- dependency between piece constructor and boardSquare constructor
- validateMove() should take board as parameter
- should i set move status in validateMove() method?
- getValidMoves() return type is ArrayList instead of Array
- we should add a method: kingCanBeKilled() and use it in getValidMoves()
