Things we need to talk about:
- dependency between piece constructor and boardSquare constructor
- validateMove() should take board as parameter
<<<<<<< HEAD
- should i set move status in validateMove() method?
- getValidMoves() return type is ArrayList instead of Array
- we should add a method: kingCanBeKilled() and use it in getValidMoves()
=======
- should i set move status in validateMove() method






we have being doing it all wrong, we should not separat fucntional code with gui code
from what i'v seen, square for example, should extend Rectangle, and have a piece as an image view
and so on (gameboard gridpane)
